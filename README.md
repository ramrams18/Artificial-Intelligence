# Artificial-Intelligence

Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success, Goals can be explicitly defined or induced.

AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.

Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.
